# Gilded Rose Refactoring Kata

This Kata was originally created by Terry Hughes (http://twitter.com/TerryHughes). It is already on GitHub [here](https://github.com/NotMyself/GildedRose). See also [Bobby Johnson's description of the kata](http://iamnotmyself.com/2011/02/13/refactor-this-the-gilded-rose-kata/).

## Approach
1. Automated tests for the existing codebase to make development more predictable and less risky. 
2. Updated to keep the number of branch points (if, for, while, etc.) low which makes units easier to modify.
3. Refactor existing code to achieve the same functionality using less volume.

## How to use
`$ git clone https://github.com/learningtocode101/gilded_rose_refactoring`  
`$ cd gilded_rose_refactoring/ruby`  
`$ bundle` to install dependencies    
`$ rspec` to check tests all pass  
`$ irb`  to interact with application.  
Run code in texttest_fixture.rb to see sample output of items quality over 30 days
